# Next.js + Tailwind React Micro Interactions

It focuses on various interactions such as tab switching between Completed and In Review, hover effects on hackathon cards, filtering by tabs containing Design, Frontend, Backend, Blockchain, and Content, dropdown functionality on profile click, and a dynamic search button with four stages: default, on hover, on select, and pasting address (Ctrl+V).
